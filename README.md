## 📊 Key Analyses

### 🧭 Customer & Seller Distribution
- São Paulo dominates with ~42% of customers and highest seller count (1849)
- Recommended market expansion to underserved states like Acre, Amazonas

### 🚚 Delivery Performance
- 34.5% of orders delayed, 65.5% delivered early, 0% on time
- Suggested refining delivery time estimation and logistics forecasting

### 💳 Payment Behavior
- 74% of customers used credit cards; 60% paid upfront
- Proposed diversifying payment options and promoting installment plans

### 📈 Satisfaction vs. Payment Value
- Weak negative correlation (r = –0.05)
- Indicates customer satisfaction more influenced by service than price

## 💡 Key Insights

- Market concentration risks from seller-customer clustering
- Delivery estimation models are misaligned with actual fulfillment
- Payment options limited; reliance on credit cards is high
- Pricing has little effect on review scores; focus needed on service quality

---
